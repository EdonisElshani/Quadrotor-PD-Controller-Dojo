# Quadrotor-PD-Controller-Dojo
Implementation of a PID Feedback controller for quadrotor drone stabilization and navigation in the Dojo simulation environment, written in Julia. This project demonstrates how classical control techniques can be implemented into simulation frameworks, enabling position and attitude control of quadrotor
