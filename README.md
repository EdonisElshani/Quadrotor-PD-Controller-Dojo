# Quadrotor-PD-Controller-Dojo [1]
Implementation of a PID Feedback controller for quadrotor drone stabilization and navigation in the Dojo simulation environment, written in Julia. This project demonstrates how classical control techniques can be implemented into simulation frameworks, enabling position and attitude control of quadrotor

## Dojo-Simulation-Environment

This project uses [**Dojo.jl**](https://dojo-sim.github.io/Dojo.jl/dev/), a differentiable simulator for robotics in Julia designed for robotics and reinforcement learning research. Dojo provides realistic rigid-body dynamics, contact modeling, and customizable environments, making it ideal for drone control experiments.

For environment initialization, setup details, and further instructions, please refer to the official [Dojo documentation](https://dojo-sim.github.io/Dojo.jl/dev/)
